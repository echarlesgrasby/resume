            This picture was taken outside of the Seaport Hotel in Boston, MA. ISO New England's Market Monitoring group organized this conference. I believe that most market monitoring entities sent a contingent (of at least a few people).
			I'm pictured on the far left. This really has been a great community of people to be part of. Few times in my life have I gotten to be immersed in such a large "think tank" of genuinely curious people.

            My mom came to this conference with me and got to hangout in Boston while I attended talks. As a grown man, I'm touched that I had the opportunity to do something so nice for my mom.
