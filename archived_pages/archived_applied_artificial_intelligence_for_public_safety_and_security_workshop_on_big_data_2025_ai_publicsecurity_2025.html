	<h1>Applied Artificial Intelligence for Public Safety and Security Workshop on Big Data, 2025 (AI-PublicSecurity-2025) held with 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Macau – December 8–11, 2025</h1>
<br><br>


 
<ul>
<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
The workshop is anticipated to enhance public safety and security through the exploration of theoretical and practical aspects related to the application and algorithms of artificial intelligence in combating criminal activities, whether in the real or virtual worlds. The workshop affords opportunities and platforms for industry partners, government agents, and academic scientists to present novel applications, advanced solutions, state-of-the-art algorithms in the domain of public safety and security.
Criminal activities jeopardize public safety with threats to societal well-being in the real world. Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) must adapt and employ new methods and approaches to detect, prevent, and control criminal activities, thereby enhancing situational awareness in investigative or law enforcement functions, tactical situations, unexpected attacks, and responses to crimes in progress.
We invite paper submissions on theories and applications of new emerging technologies aimed at enhancing public safety and security. Topics of interest for this workshop include :

<ol>
<strong>I. Artificial Intelligence </strong>

<h4> Call for Committee Members </h4>

We invite researchers who have been active in big data and artificial intelligence to volunteer their efforts and serve on the AI-PublicSecurity-2025 committee (PC). The quality of workshop depends heavily on the paper review process which is performed by the PC members. We hope that this call will allow us to attract people with complementary expertise to join the PC and enhance public safety and security through artificial intelligence.

Note that there will not be any face-to- face PC meeting and all reviews will be handled electronically. We expect that each member of the PC will review 3-4 papers on average. The review period will be between July 1 and November 1, 2025. In recognition of your efforts, your name will be mentioned in the workshop website. To be considered, please provide the following information to weidai [AT] pnw.edu:
<li>Your name, affiliation, institutional/company email address, and short bio
</li><li>List one to three topics that best represent the focus of your research and expertise
</li><li>List relevant topic where you have been a member of the Program Committee</li><li>

</li></ul>
