	<p> This is a list of the books that I own, either in print or in digital. They are spread out across a few places (namely my apartment and a storage unit [climate controlled] that I rent).
		This is partially to give me a mobile listing that I can use to weed out titles that I already own when going to thrift shops.
		Others, however, may also be interested in what all books I own and have read.
	</p>
	<p> I love to read, and I love collecting, trading, and recommending books. If you are interested in any of the titles that you see here and want to know more about them, my thoughts, or want to
		chat about your experience with any of these titles (or ones that aren't here)- feel free to send me an email. 
	</p>
	<p> The coolest bookstore that I ever went to was Powell's Books in Portland, OR. If that changes (I highly doubt it), I'll let you know.
		The second coolest was the Dickson Street Book Shop near the University of Arkansas' campus in Fayetteville, AR.
		One of the bookshops near Harvard was pretty cool too. I can't recall what the name was, but it was probably like "The Harvard Bookstore" (or some other equally uninspired name).
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't like Barnes and Noble for 2 reasons: 
		<ol>
			<li>They are usually pretty bad about keeping their shelves stocked</li>
			<li>I got kicked out of one when I was in college and I'm still a little embarassed about it.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>&#128214; - I have read it.</li>
			<li>&#128241; - I own it as an eBook or PDF.</li>
			<li>&#128218; - I own it as both an eBook/PDF and as a hard copy.</li>
		</ul>
