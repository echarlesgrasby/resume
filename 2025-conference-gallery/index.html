            This picture was taken outside of the Seaport Hotel in Boston, MA. ISO New England's Market Monitoring group organized this conference. I believe that most market monitoring entities sent a contingent (of at least a few people).
			I'm pictured on the far left. This really has been a great community of people to be part of. Few times in my life have I gotten to be immersed in such a large "think tank" of genuinely curious people.

            Mark Rouse and I went to WUSS 2025 (the "Western Users of SAS Software conference; yes, the founders were well aware of the acronym...). We had some neat encounters while we were there. I met a lot of people that I, regretably, did not get pictures with.
			I think that the coolest "claim to fame", at this conference, was getting to meet Susan Slaughter --- the author of "The Little SAS Book" series. She gave a 3-part lecture that covered the Essentials of SAS, and I sat in on all 3 sessions.

            This conference ended up working out (the timing of it) in a way that I was able to take my girlfriend Rebecca with me. She hadn't had a chance to ever set foot in California (or even see an ocean!), so we remedied both of these problems with her tagging along.
